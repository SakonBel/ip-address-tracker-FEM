## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind Css
- JavaScript
- Regular Expression
- API
- React
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Tailwind CSS

This project is a tough one about CSS for me because I use Tailwind in my project for the first time. Can't say that I love how Tailwind work that much, but I've manage to get the work done. The utilities CSS classes nature in tailwind make me have to constantly look at the documentation for every little thing to be able to know what the classs it use. That make me waste a lot of time styling CSS. Anyway, I think I will keep learning Tailwind because I think it will be later come in handy(when I'm good enough).

#### JavaScript

Since this project is React-base JavaScript is the essential here. The concept that I learned in this project is asynchronous JavaScript and how to fetch the resource. How to use Promises and the methods that come with it. I think I gain quite a knowledge in this.

#### React

I'm still continue learning React in this project and I think I need to learn more about many concept in React. In this project I begin to use the Ref hook for the first time and also trying to minimize the rendering as much as possible. I'm still have a long way to perfect React but I will keep on learning.

#### Regular Expression

This project is again require the use of RegEx(or so I thought). That's why I be able to use RegEx again and polish my knowledge about RegEx and how it work.

#### API

The main goal for this project is the API. I've come to learned how it work, how we can use it and overcome API concept that intimidate me for a long time thanks to this project. I've use 2 APIs in this project too and this kind of reinforce me to learn API twice and I think it good for me to let the concept sink in.

### Continued development

I have come to realise the importance about what the tool I should use, and how to use the tools properly for the project. So I think in the next project I may try to learn how to use some tools. the area that I want to learn next is...

- Performance
- Browser tools
- Testing
- More React methods
- Accessibility
- Deployment

### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) - This youtube channel give me the understanding of how API work and what it actually is. Before this all of this word sound so mysterious to me. Many thanks for this awesome community.

- [The Net Ninja youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) - Shaun is a great teacher and a great programmer at the same time. No one is able to explain the concept as clear as him, so I will recommend anyone who want to learn concept of some topic to have a look in this channel. You won't regret it.

- [Web Dev Simplify youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) - I watch the video in this site from time to time to expand my knowledge. Sometimes I find that the problem at hand can be solve by using the methods in this site. And I know some concept that other site don't provide too.

- [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - As always a good site for finding many kind of answers.
